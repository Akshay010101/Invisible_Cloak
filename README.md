# INVISIBLE CLOAK

This is a fun project. I tried to make similar effect like harry potter's invisible cloak. Actually, in the movie, it was edited footage. Like, after recording the scene, VFX artists
apply some effect manually and render the footage; however, this project provides the live result. It requires a normal green piece of cloth and runs the application. When it runs, your body parts will remove or transparent. Only, for instance, that body parts will transparent, which are covered by a green cloak.
